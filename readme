# Area Control Game

Influenced by
 - Diplomacy
 - Twilight Imperium
 - 
 
## Goals
 - Diplomacy style communication and gameplay
 - Turn based gameplay, where all actions are parsed simultaneously
 - Agendas & Voting, that change the gameplay rules
 - Simple Resource management
 - Trading between players is possible
 - Simple Tech research with small tree
 - Objective based victory instead of pure area control
 - Deterministic combat with some modifications from tech (maybe player powers).
 - Can work on multiple playercounts
 - On default maps for different plyeer counts
 
 
 
 
## Actions (for units)
 - Move
   - Move/Attack to area next to current one
 - Support
   - Support Move or Hold action happening in other area 
 - Hold
   - Hold this area against incoming attack (+1 Power)
 - Convoy
   - Move units through this area
 - Build
   - Construct a building in this area

### Order of processing

First order to be processed is HOLD. This increases the power of that area by 1.
Next all move related commands are processed (Move, Support, Convoy).

### Supports

All commands with support are checked


Builds are processed last, unless they have been interrupted.

## Economy
 - All controlled areas produce 1 resource per tun
 - All controlled cities produce 1 resource per turn
 - Units (exect infantryu) are produced in factories
 - Infantry can be produced in any city
 - Units can construct buildings
 

## Buildings
 - Factory, City, allows construction of units
 - Mine, Not city, Area produces +1 resource
 - Barracks, City, +1 power to armies defending this city
 - Research Lab, City, City produces 1 research point

 
## Objectives
 - Control X amount of player capitals
 - Control X amount of Cities
 - Generate X amount of resource Y in a turn


## Units
 - Infantry, Land, Power 1
 - Navy, Naval, Power 3
 - Tank, Land, Power 2, Cannot construct, No hold bonus,
 - Artillery, Land, Power 1, Power 3 when supporting
 - Planes, City, Power 2, Cannot construct or capture cities, must move from city to city, Support range 3
